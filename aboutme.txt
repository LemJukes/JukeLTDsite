My name is Rob Garner.
I am a native of Washington DC and Maryland, USA.
I make silly things. I also, hopefully, sometimes make slightly less silly things.
I work in theatrical production by trade and have for over a decade.
My passion lies with creating things that calm the frantic jumble of impulses my brain na√Øvely believes are "good ideas". Occasionally it is correct.
